CWC or Chess with Chance is a project developed by the Hatboro-Horsham Chess Club.
It was an idea that the Co-President Numan Karyagdi Came up with, and coded most of it himself, the devolopement was aided by Co-President Jake Salters and other members.
All of it is coded in the python coding language and uses the appropriate libraries and packages
Most of the images are AI gen via ChatGPt4-Some of them are from the internet and others pictures we have taken and/or owned
The premise of it is that you play chess and every 3 moves(white then black then white and vice versa) you draw a card with a random effect
It was designed to be like drawing chance cards from monopoly but in a chess format
A kids edition was later developed for younger kids to play(ages 5-10 or so) in order to accomadate for an event the club was involved in
All code behind CWC is listed on this GitHub(by its appropriate version) to allow for transparency and a guarentee of what code you are running by using the .exe
All .zip files are compressed files containing folders with the python executeable that allows one to play CWC and the neccesary images it pulls
